1. About

hamsterdb is a database engine written in C/C++. It is fast, production-proven
and easy to use.

This release fixes a few bugs and improves Transactional performance.
Committed Transactions are no longer flushed immediately to the btree but
are buffered and flushed together with other committed Transactions. If
you prefer the old behavior then use the flag HAM_FLUSH_WHEN_COMMITTED when
creating or opening your Environment.

The Btree code was cleaned up and most of the complexity was removed by
reorganizing the SMOs.

Also, the license was changed to APL (Apache Public License 2.0).
hamsterdb is now free to use for closed-source applications.

The AES encryption was removed. This will be part of a commercial "pro" version
which will be available soon, together with more new functionality (i.e.
compression, hot backups etc). No other features were removed. Visit the blog
(http://crupp.de) for more background information regarding the license change.

2. Changes

New Features
* Added flag HAM_DISABLE_RECOVERY; disables recovery/journal when used in 
	combination with HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS

Bugfixes
* issue #32: fixed segfault during recovery
* Fixed a journalling bug; partial records were not logged correctly

Other Changes
* License is now APL 2.0
* Committed Transactions are no longer flushed immediately, but can be
	buffered and flushed together with other committed Transactions
* Removed a parameter from ham_db_check_integrity

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap
- See https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb/wiki/Roadmap

4. Features

- PRO: SIMD instructions for lookups (numeric keys w/o duplicates)
- PRO: transparent AES encryption
- PRO: transparent compression for journal, keys and records using 
    zlib, snappy, lzf or lzo 
- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Supports multiple databases in one file
- Supports record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Supports duplicate keys
- Support for logging and recovery
- Support for unlimited number of parallel Transactions
- Support for partial reading/writing of records
- Support for network access (remote databases) via TCP/Protocol Buffers
- Basic schema support for POD types (i.e. uint32, uint64, real32 etc)
- Very fast database cursors
- Configurable page size, cache size, key size etc
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows and other architectures
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
  mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Open source and released under APL 2.0 license
- Wrappers for C++, Java, .NET, Erlang, Ada and others

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (the default)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb

Porting hamsterdb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, hamsterdb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ham_export linked against the old version.
(ham_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of hamsterdb installed). Then use the newest version of
ham_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ham_export
and ham_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ham_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ham_export-2.1.2 to document
        that it's an older version):

    ham_export-2.1.2 input.db | ham_import --stdin output.db

12. Licensing

hamsterdb is released under the APL 2.0 license, which allows
unrestricted use for commercial and non-commercial applications. See the
file COPYING for more information.

A commercial, closed source version hamsterdb pro with additional functionality
is available on request. See http://hamsterdb.com for more information.
